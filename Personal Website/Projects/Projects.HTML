            <p>Red Plum WP Marketing Research Campaign - UT at Dallas Academic Project</p>
            <br>
            <p>As a "rookie" competitor in the website building industry RedPlum WP tasked us with conducting a landscape analysis on their competitors. Based on the research and data sources we found we built recommendations that could imporve her overall performance while focusing on the client's journey. We succesfully identified key solutions such as page load time, social media marketing through TikTok, Google RSAs, and LinkedIn marketing to increase her engagement with potential prospects. After concluding the project, our presentation was met with positive feedback from the professor and the founder of the company. Overall, this was an insightful project that allowed my team and I use different platforms such as AirTable, SurveyMonkey, and Moz.com.

            <p>Under His True Light Google Marketing Campaign - UT at Dallas Academic Project</p>
            <br> 
            <p>The purpose of the project was to better optimize the landing page, however we decided to take that to the next level and
            overhauled her old Google campaign. After analyzing and lots of keyword research we added various negative
            exact/phrase and phrase match keywords to increase traffic, while reducing bounces at the same time. We also requested spam
            backlinks to be removed. Overall, the SEO score improved from a poor score of 21 to a moderate score of 53 at the end of the semester. The site also saw an
            exponential increase in clicks (43%) and impressions (57%) after implementing the new Google Ads campaign.</p>
